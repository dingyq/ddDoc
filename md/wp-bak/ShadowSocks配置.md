* Step 1. Install Shadowsocks GUI application

	For Windows 7 or earlier, download shadowsocks-win-2.3.zip
	
	For Windows 8 or later, download shadowsocks-win-dotnet4.0-2.3.zip
	
	Alternatively, you may download the latest version from developer's website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/shadowsocksgui/files/dist/
	
	Once downloaded, extract the .zip file and launch Shadowsocks.exe

* Step 2. Shadowsocks GUI settings

	Enter settings exactly as shown below.
	
	Note that you can simply copy-paste fields marked in yellow:

	1.1.1.1
	
	443
	
	YWI5YTg1Mj
	
	aes-256-cfb
	
	1080

	Then click OK.

* Step 3. Browser proxy settings

	At this point you may right-click the Shadowsocks tray icon and
	Enable System Proxy. Then right-click the icon again
	and enable Mode -> Global. This will update system-wide proxy
	settings â€“ this will work for Google Chrome as well as Microsoft Internet Explorer.
	
	Alternatively, manual browser configuration is possible:

	Proxy type: SOCKS v5
	
	Proxy IP (Socks Host): 127.0.0.1
	
	Port: 1080
